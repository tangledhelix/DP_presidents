* [x] Fractions used throughout the book
* [x] Some images may be better off relocated. In particular, one is within a blockquote section (a party platform) and is therefore has narrower margins than the others.
* [x] Since paragraphs get indented, current blockquote indent may not be enough on left margin; increase it? Or shift to the right? Currently left margin is narrower than right.
* [x] Use `<section>` around some chapters? Some of the portraits appeared before the chapter start, in the printed book. Rather than move them to within the chapter, it may be possible to wrap the entire chapter in a `<section>` instead. Would need to verify how the ToC links would work, how the EPUB ToC would lay out, etc.
    * This doesn't solve the ToC problem.
* [x] SR the tables in the browser; they render very badly on Kindle
* [x] Abbreviations and other places to use `<abbr>` (including the aforementioned fractions, probably) are throughout the book. Many may just need to be caught in a smoothread, but some can be searched.
    * [x] State initials (but not others such as `Vt.` or `Mass.`?)
    * [x] Abbreviated names of political parties could be added (need to read for context)
    * [x] Fractions
    * Many initials are used, these are just people and should NOT be using `<abbr>`
    * [x] First pass is done; revisit during SR phase
    * [x] After SR, remove the pink highlight on abbreviations, or other abbr CSS no longer needed.
* [x] Some tables use 6 dashes (not 4 or 2) - 3 x em-dash?
    * probably better to use ― HORIZONTAL BAR, U+2015 here? For the char width? and these are not semantically a "dash" - they just represent a null value in the column...
* [x] Should reposition some images to be within their chapter, not at the end of prior chapter. Washington is one, others may be the same.
* [x] Reprocess some images (cleanup isn't in the exports...)
    * [x] fillmore.jpg
    * [x] front.jpg
    * [x] johnson.jpg (maybe?)

### Forum notes ###

* [Alternate edition](https://books.google.com/books?id=v8kzAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover) might be useful to resolve questions about illegible text. Be careful, it's not the same edition (1905 vs. 1900)
    * 339: the above edition was used by a proofer to resolve a question about the vote count for `Arkansas Hancock 1880`: `60 7?5` resolved to `60 775`
    * 477: used to find missing letters in `Socialists’ Labor Party`
* There are tables with vertical text.
* 481.png was replaced at some point

### Proofer's notes ###

* 083: `Charlotteville[** Charlottesville]`
    * Research does not indicate this is an older name of this city
    * Ngrams usage is low enough to suggest this is a typo
* 141: `Executive usurpation."[**missing open-quote]`
    * Checked TIA source; no indication where quote begins
    * Checked several other TIA scans; no indication in any of them
    * No Hathitrust scans have beginning quote either
    * One viewable Google Books edition also doesn't
    * Resolution: without indication where open-quote lies, leave as printed.
* 146: `portrayng[**portraying]`
    * corrected; ngrams indicates no usage
* 148: `responsibilty[**responsibility]`
    * corrected: ngrams indicates no usage
* 202: `Commitee[**Committee]`
    * corrected: ngrams indicates no usage
* 213: `45[**55]`
    * Number is clearly part of a sequence: corrected
* 261: `conventon[**convention]`
    * Corrected
* 265: `enthusiam[**enthusiasm]`
    * Corrected
* 343: `nomition[**nomination]`
    * Corrected
* 347: `aways[**always]`
    * Corrected
* 388: `spirt[**spirit]`
    * Corrected
* 408: `denfinite[**definite]`
    * Corrected
* 426: `his[**their]`
    * Given that politics / governance was utterly male-dominated in this era, this is likely exactly what the author intended to write.
    * Leaving as printed; we preserve, we don't modernize.
* 441: `out[**ought]`
    * Missing 2 entire letters is very unusual...
    * Out of caution leaving this as printed; might be an unfamiliar old form.
* 475: `nominaiton[**nomination]`
    * Corrected
* 481: `in restraint[**unclear]`
    * Reviewing a different scanset, "in its restraint"
    * Corrected

### Joined hyphenated words ###
* `antislavery` -- standardized to `antislavery` form
    * `anti-*slavery`
        * 188: part of main text
        * 201: part of main text
    * `anti-slavery`
        * 470: index entry (points to 186 - where there is no hyphen!)
    * `antislavery`
        * 21 occurrences

### Spellcheck ###

* 467: `Bently, Rev. Charles E.` does not match the referenced pages, which both show `Bentley`. Corroborated by Wikipedia.
* 477: `Tellfair, Edward` does not match referenced pages, which both show `Telfair`. Corroborated by Wikipedia.

Transcriber’s Note


Some inconsistencies in spelling, hyphenation, and punctuation have been
retained.

* p. 56: changed “Charlotteville” to “Charlottesville” (in June, in Charlottesville)

#### Text version only

This file uses _underscores_ to indicate italic text and =equals= to indicate bold text. Small capitals changed to all capitals.

#### HTML version only

### HTML file review ###

* [x] Safari
* [x] Firefox
* [x] Edge
* [x] Chrome
* [x] iPhone simulator
* [x] iPad simulator

### Ebook review ###

* [x] check how the superscript/subscript fractions render (e.g. 5/16)

* Adobe Digital Editions (Mac)
    * Wide tables don't render well (expected)
    * Whenever you page over a chapter boundary the next-button stops working until you click into the page contents again. (???)
    * The horizontal bars in some tables (representing empty values) are rendered with a bit of space between them.
    * Fractions seem to render ok.
    * Abbr's are highlighted and show value on hover
    * [x] Add page-break before ad pages?
    * [x] Add page-break between two sections of ads?
    * [x] Add page-break before transcriber's note? But it's an h2 already?? But the div has the coloring so it can still bleed from prior page, so still do a page break? Is the h2 nobreak?
* Apple Books (iPad)
    * [x] Add page-break between frontispiece and title page?
    * The horizontal bars in some tables (representing empty values) are shown with no space between them, like a single bar.
    * Fraction rendering looks good.
* Apple Books (Mac)
    * No new issues compared to iPad review
* Apple Books (iPhone)
    * No new issues compared to iPad review
* Google Play Books (Android)
    * Tables render weird, including width changes as you turn a page mid-table
    * [x] put page break between image & h2 for chapters when the image is just prior to the h2
* Moon+ Reader
    * Doesn't seem to scale images properly, or maybe it can't handle ems? The title page publisher stamp is not the right size.
    * ToC table has border around whole table, and between each line, even though no borders are defined in CSS
    * ToC has wrong alignments, the page nubmer column is not aligned properly (should be right-aligned)
    * Table of illustrations is similar
    * The table rendering is so broken. It's like it doesn't even know what a column is. Giving up on this, it's just really messed up for tables.
    * Might not even evaluate Moon+ on future books.
* Kindle (Android)
    * The mixed numbers aren't laying out like I hoped; there's a gap between the whole number and the fraction. I adjusted the margins on the table cells but it's either not honoring them or applying a minimum or something, because something is getting in the way...
    * Kindle does a pretty good job with tables, although sometimes they show up like a weird thumbnail you have to tap on. It's still better than a lot of readers are.
* Kindle Paperwhite
    * Images are not centered in page, they are offset and go off-page to the right.
    * Image captions do as well; so it's the figcaption element that's off center, maybe?
    * Fractions are ok. They are properly nudged together, not with a gap like the Android app shows.
    * Need a few extra page breaks as in the other books.
* Kindle Previewer 3 (Mac)
    * The uncentered and off-page images observed on the Paperwhite are not observed in the E-ink emulation mode of the Previewer; interesting. It's normally a pretty faithful reproduction. Need to re-inspect the CSS, but it seems to be unique to that one device, at least so far.
    * [x] Set of tables toward end of book "POPULAR VOTE.", "ELECTORAL VOTE." do not have centered titles. Just before "Summary of popular votes for presidents" chapter begins.
* Kobo Libra Colour (renamed kepub)
    * letter-spacing still doesn't work (saw this in whorepoem too?) so that on title page, "OUR PRESIDENTS" appears as if no space is between the two words.
    * Wide tables don't render well; they just go off page and are not in any way apparently viewable
    * Most images were displayed with a modified aspect ratio - mostly seems they were squashed a bit as if compressing the Y-axis to make the figures more squat and broad than original
    * [x] Maybe check Kindle again and see if the same thing was going on there?
    * Horizontal bars rendered with tiny bit of space between them, not one bar
    * Some table cell borders aren't drawn - probably due to rowspans? An example is the 1836 column in the big table of popular votes toward the end of the book (p. 396) - the vertical line between the two cells with the oversized braces is not drawn; only the border between cells on the Van Buren line is drawn.
* Kobo Libra Colour (converted kepub)
    * No discernable differences from renamed-epub version
* Calibre (Mac)
    * Seems to squash image aspect ratios as described in Kobo section
    * Has issues with wide tables, rendering onto the next page too
    * Shows abbr's on hover

### Smooth Reading ###

Notes for SR:
* There are many tables, and some are wide; may render poorly on e-readers
* HTML version: abbreviations are highlighted in a light pink color, hover to see tooltip

My own SR findings:
* Political party names found (for use in `<abbr>` tags). It's not clear these are all actually parties proper, some may be factions.
    * Abolition party / Abolitionists
    * `Amer.` American party, a.k.a. the "Know-Nothing" party
    * American National party (possibly the same as above, but didn't seem like it)
    * `Anti-M.` Anti-Masons
    * Anti-Monopoly party
    * Barnburners, a.k.a. "Softs"
    * Constitutional Union party
    * `Dem.` Democratic party, a.k.a. "The Democracy" / originally called the Republican party
    * Federalists / Federalist party
    * `F. Soil` Free-Soil
    * `F. D.` Free-Soil Democrats
    * Free Silver party
    * `Gre'nb` Greenback party
    * Hunkers, a.k.a. "Hards"
    * `Ind.` Independent (later Greenback?) - also possible in earlier elections to simply mean independent from a party? The name works either way, I suppose.
    * Labor Reformers
    * Labor-Socialistic
    * Liberal Republican party
    * `Lib.` Liberty party
    * Mugwump
    * `Nat.` National party (offspring / descendant of the Greenback party?)
        * elsewhere a platform uses this name and they are seceders from the Prohibition?
    * National Democratic party, a.k.a. "sound-money Democrats", "National Democracy"
    * National Greenback party
    * `Nat. R.` National Republican (later "Republican")
    * National Silver party
    * `Peop.`, `Pop.` The People’s party, a.k.a. the Populists
    * `Pro.`, `Temp.` Prohibition National party (same as National Prohibition party?) aka Temperance
        * Opposing factions "Narrow-Gaugers" and "Broad-Gaugers"
    * Prohibition Reform party
    * Prohibition-Home-Protection party (renamed to the Prohibition party in 1884 platform)
    * Radical party
    * `Rep.` Republican party (the 2nd one; original "Republican" party became the Democratic party)
    * `Soc. L.` Socialist Labor party
    * Tammany / Tammany Hall
    * `U. L.` Union Labor party
    * `U’d L.` United Labor party
    * "The Wide-Awakes" -- some kind of Republican offshoot organization?
* Abbreviations
    * p. 79: `Com. Stewart, Pa.`
    * p. 82: `Com. Stewart, Pennsylvania`
        * On p. 106 is a reference to Andrew Stewart of Pa. Other references to Stewart are not Pennsylvanians.
        * There are two Andrew Stewarts from Pennsylvania I found on Wikipedia:
        * The contest in question was in 1844
        * [father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Stewart_(American_politician,_died_1872)) born 1791 died 1872
        * [son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Stewart_(American_politician,_died_1903)) born 1836 died 1903
            * In 1844 the son would have been 8 years old, must be the father (aged 53 in 1844)
        * I guessed "Committeeman" as the father was chairman of the United States House Committee on Manufactures, but I'm not sure about it.
        * Going to leave it with no `<abbr>` tag.
* On Kindle Paperwhite, the portraits and their captions are offset to the right rather than centered with auto-balanced margins. I find no reason in the CSS for this and it displays normally in a browser. Nothing obvious to fix here.
