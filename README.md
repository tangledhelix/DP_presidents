### Things to revisit ###

* [x] Fractions used throughout the book
* [ ] Abbreviations and other places to use `<abbr>` (including the aforementioned fractions, probably) are throughout the book. Many may just need to be caught in a smoothread, but some can be searched.
    * [ ] State initials (but not others such as `Vt.` or `Mass.`?)
    * [ ] Abbreviated names of political parties could be added (need to read for context)
    * [x] Fractions
    * Many initials are used, these are just people and should NOT be using `<abbr>`
    * [ ] First pass is done; revisit during SR phase
    * [ ] After SR, remove the pink highlight on abbreviations.
* [x] Some tables use 6 dashes (not 4 or 2) - 3 x em-dash?
    * probably better to use ― HORIZONTAL BAR, U+2015 here? For the char width? and these are not semantically a "dash" - they just represent a null value in the column...
* [x] Should reposition some images to be within their chapter, not at the end of prior chapter. Washington is one, others may be the same.
* [x] Reprocess some images (cleanup isn't in the exports...)

### Forum notes ###

* [Alternate edition](https://books.google.com/books?id=v8kzAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover) might be useful to resolve questions about illegible text. Be careful, it's not the same edition (1905 vs. 1900)
    * 339: the above edition was used by a proofer to resolve a question about the vote count for `Arkansas Hancock 1880`: `60 7?5` resolved to `60 775`
    * 477: used to find missing letters in `Socialists’ Labor Party`
* There are tables with vertical text.
* 481.png was replaced at some point

### Proofer's notes ###

* 083: `Charlotteville[** Charlottesville]`
    * Research does not indicate this is an older name of this city
    * Ngrams usage is low enough to suggest this is a typo
* 141: `Executive usurpation."[**missing open-quote]`
    * Checked TIA source; no indication where quote begins
    * Checked several other TIA scans; no indication in any of them
    * No Hathitrust scans have beginning quote either
    * One viewable Google Books edition also doesn't
    * Resolution: without indication where open-quote lies, leave as printed.
* 146: `portrayng[**portraying]`
    * corrected; ngrams indicates no usage
* 148: `responsibilty[**responsibility]`
    * corrected: ngrams indicates no usage
* 202: `Commitee[**Committee]`
    * corrected: ngrams indicates no usage
* 213: `45[**55]`
    * Number is clearly part of a sequence: corrected
* 261: `conventon[**convention]`
    * Corrected
* 265: `enthusiam[**enthusiasm]`
    * Corrected
* 343: `nomition[**nomination]`
    * Corrected
* 347: `aways[**always]`
    * Corrected
* 388: `spirt[**spirit]`
    * Corrected
* 408: `denfinite[**definite]`
    * Corrected
* 426: `his[**their]`
    * Given that politics / governance was utterly male-dominated in this era, this is likely exactly what the author intended to write.
    * Leaving as printed; we preserve, we don't modernize.
* 441: `out[**ought]`
    * Missing 2 entire letters is very unusual...
    * Out of caution leaving this as printed; might be an unfamiliar old form.
* 475: `nominaiton[**nomination]`
    * Corrected
* 481: `in restraint[**unclear]`
    * Reviewing a different scanset, "in its restraint"
    * Corrected

### Joined hyphenated words ###
* `antislavery` -- standardized to `antislavery` form
    * `anti-*slavery`
        * 188: part of main text
        * 201: part of main text
    * `anti-slavery`
        * 470: index entry (points to 186 - where there is no hyphen!)
    * `antislavery`
        * 21 occurrences

### Spellcheck ###

* 467: `Bently, Rev. Charles E.` does not match the referenced pages, which both show `Bentley`. Corroborated by Wikipedia.
* 477: `Tellfair, Edward` does not match referenced pages, which both show `Telfair`. Corroborated by Wikipedia.

#### Text version only

This file uses _underscores_ to indicate italic text and =equals= to indicate bold text. Small capitals changed to all capitals.

#### HTML version only

### Ebook review ###

* [ ] check how the superscript/subscript fractions render (e.g. 5/16)

### Smooth Reading ###

Notes for SR:
* There are many tables, and some are wide; may render poorly on e-readers
* HTML version: abbreviations are highlighted in a light pink color, hover to see tooltip
